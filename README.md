To run the project, just restart kernel and run all cells. You will need to get a Spotify token and input it in line 1 of code cell 2 where it says token. Warning: It may take a while for all of the code to run since there is a lot of data for the API to run through. 

The project starts off with the introduction and data analysis portion of the techincal report. The blocks of code involves loading the first data set and doing the initial cleaning. After that is the Spotify script. The final cleaning of the data is and the visualization of the first set is after that, followed by the classifications. The classification results portion of the technical report is after that. Next is the second dataset in the same order. Initial loading and cleaning of the data, more cleaning and data visualization. After all of that, the hypothesis testing and t-tests are next with the conclusion portion of the technical report ending the project.
